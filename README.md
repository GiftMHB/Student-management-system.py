# Student Management System (Python CLI Project)

## This is my first Python project, built as part of my learning journey to understand real-world Python programming using:
>File handling
>Functions
>Lists & Dictionaries
>User input validation
### The application runs in the terminal (command-line interface) and allows you to manage student records stored in a text file.
